# Predicting Boston Housing Prices

#### Introduction

The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and we want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete, we decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist a client with finding the best selling price for their home. 
We have the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. The task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for  clients' homes.


#### Description

In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:

* 16 data points have an 'MEDV' value of 50.0. These data points likely contain missing or censored values and have been removed.
* 1 data point has an 'RM' value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an outlier and has been removed.
* The features 'RM', 'LSTAT', 'PTRATIO', and 'MEDV' are essential. The remaining non-relevant features have been excluded.
* The feature 'MEDV' has been multiplicatively scaled to account for 35 years of market inflation.
