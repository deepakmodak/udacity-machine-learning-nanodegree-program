# Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree Program
Co-created with kaggle.

#### Definition 
> Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed. (Source wikipedia)


#### Why take machine learning program?
> Are you fascinated by how Netflix recommends the movies you’ll like or Spotify renders Discover Weekly? Have you wondered what is the Google algorithm that shows you such accurate search results? Machine Learning is behind these innovations.It represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. 

#### What to expect in this program ?
> Learn basic data analysis concepts, the core concepts of Machine Learning like Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Deep dive with Reinforcement Learning concepts Markov Decision Processes and Monte Carlo methods.
