    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

This additional space/rooms is typically something people would be willing to pay for, thus increasing the value of the home (MEDV).\n",

    "\n",
    "**PTRATIO**: An increase in value of PTRATIO would decrease the value of MEDV. An increase in the student-teacher ratio/more students per teacher (PTRATIO) is typically a result of lack of funding for the school or lack of good quality teachers wanting to work in the neighborhood - and perceived as a bad/not as good a place for families be live. In turn, people/families would rather live elsewhere and those who can afford to move do, and again, home values (MEDV) decreases as \"the market\" (those who can't afford to move) cannot sustain the higher home prices.\n",

    "I choose the one with max_depth as 3. As more training points are fed, both training curve and testing curve are converging to about 0.8 score.\n",
    "Having more training points will benefit the model by making curve converge. Once converged, adding more training points seems to have no significant help. At least it won't hurt the accuracy but there's a trade-off here that acquiring or training more data may cost more. A good balance is needed here."

    "### Complexity Curves\n",
    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

   "source": [
    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "With a maximun depth of 10, model suffers from high variance since training score is 1.0 but validation score is about 0.7 it turns out our model is overfitting and too sensitive to the dataset.\n",
    "With a maximum depth of 1, model suffers from high bias. Two scores are quit close that it's not a high variance problem and both scores are too far from acceptable so I think it's a high bias problem."

    "\n",
    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

    "As max_depth increases, bias becomes lower and variance becomes higher. I want to keep a banlance between these tow. After depth 4, two scores diverge and validation score starts to goes down, so I know it begins to suffer from high variance and 4 is a good choice. And of course it has the highest validation score."

    "\n",
    "When thinking about how k-fold cross validation helps grid search, think about the main drawbacks of grid search which are hinged upon **using a particular subset of data for training or testing** and how k-fold cv could help alleviate that.

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a model validation technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. Different from Question 3, what it does is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1] The data set is divided into k subsets, and the train & test procedure is repeated k times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2] Each time, one of the k subsets is used as the test set and the other k-1 subsets are put together to form a training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3] The average of the k testing experiments are used as the overall result of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit is that it matters less how the data gets divided, every data point gets to be in a test set exactly once, and gets to be in a training set k-1 times. In this way, model will suffer less from high variance. Otherwise, GridSearch may return a tuned model that relies on a specific division of train and test sets but predict poorly in a general situation."

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in scikit-learn versions 0.17 and 0.18.\n",
    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.\n",
    "  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. \n",
