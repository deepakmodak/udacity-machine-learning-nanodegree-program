# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon


#### Description

In this project, we will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). We will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the tasks. 

> Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allow to investigate data and make inferences based on observations. A foundation in statistics also allow to be a consumer of analyses that others perform, and allow to relate to the conclusions others have drawn from their investigations.


#### Definition
Stroop effect refers to demonstration of interference in reaction time of the task. In this experiment, we will compare the two samples gathered using congruent words condition and incongruent words condition. The test shows there is a significant difference in the reaction time of the people in the two cases.

The test consists of two phases: 

1. Congruent Words Condition
   
   Reading the color of the ink with which the words are written, given that the color of the words and the word itself are same.

2. Incongruent Words Condition
   
   Reading the color of the ink with which the words are written, given that the color of the ink of the words and the word itself are different.

Investigation 

Independent Variable –  Ink color congruency to word name. In other words, is the test on Congruent Words or Incongruent Words.

Dependent Variable – Reaction time of the person. 

Hypothesis  - There is no significant difference in the reaction time of the two tests
