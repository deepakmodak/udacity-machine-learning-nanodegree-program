# Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree Program
Co-created with kaggle.

#### Definition 
> Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed. (Source wikipedia)


#### Why take machine learning program?
> Are you fascinated by how Netflix recommends the movies youâ€™ll like or Spotify renders Discover Weekly? Have you wondered what is the Google algorithm that shows you such accurate search results? Machine Learning is behind these innovations.It represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. 

#### What to expect in this program ?
> Learn basic data analysis concepts, the core concepts of Machine Learning like Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Deep dive with Reinforcement Learning concepts Markov Decision Processes and Monte Carlo methods.
